      <h3>Physical & Mental Benefits of Hiking</h3>
      <p>
        Hiking builds stronger muscles and bones, decreases the risk of certain
        respiratory problems, and improves your sense of balance and heart
        health. Hiking does not only benefit your physical health, but your
        mental health as well. Being in nature and spending quality time in the
        great outdoors reduces stress, calms anxiety, and can lead to a lower
        risk of depression.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one study, researchers found that people walking for 90 minutes in a
        natural area as opposed to an urban, high-traffic area showed decreased
        activity in a region of the brain associated with a key factor in
        depression. In another research study, time in nature was found to have
        a positive effect on mood and aspects of cognitive function, including
        working memory, as well as a dampening effect on anxiety.
